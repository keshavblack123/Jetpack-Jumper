# Jetpack Jumper

## Genre : Platformer  

## Game Description
The main goal of the game is to use the jetpack mechanic, mentioned in earlier sections above on Background Study, to reach the end of a series of platforms to reach the ultimate endpoint. There will be different obstacles/challenges that players have to use this mechanic to navigate through to progress upwards, all will be focused on gatekeeping or knocking players back down. As with Foddian games, there would not be any progress that is saved each run, falling off platforms will knock you back as far as you fall before landing on a platform. The only way to end the game is to reach the final platform.

## Story
The context is that players start at the bottom with zero explanation of the story and who they are playing as. As the player progresses upwards, the scenery changes to give a sense of ascension into the sky. Ultimately, reaching the final platform will reveal a portal that brings the player into a different dimension. This would add the final context to the story of why the player has been trying to travel upwards through difficult obstacles, the full story is interpretive for whether the player is trying to escape, explore or just doing this for fun. The self-insertion of the player's emotions completes the story.
